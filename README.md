## My React Website (With MongoDB Integration):

Personal website created using ReactJS on the frontend and MongoDB on the backend. ExpressJS was used as a framework to connect to backend.

# Website includes:
- Home page that lists my github repos, their date committed, their descriptions, as well as a link to each repo page.
- Music page that has a link to my music youtube channel as well as displays the 12 most recent uploads to the channel( This had to be done manually, since the Youtube API only allows a few requests per day on the free tier).
- Resume page with a list of Related Coursework and experience that is sourced from my MongoDB backend and dynamically updates based on input to the database.
